{"title": "Caballerango", "abstract": "Caballerango (Horse Wrangler) is a 2018 Mexican documentary film, director Juan Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez's debut feature. It's a portrait of residents of Milpillas in Los Altos de Jalisco as they grapple with the sudden death of a young horse wrangler named Nando. The editing alternates wide shots of landscape and community with more intimate scenes where the director, a native of the region himself, asks questions of those onscreen. Gradually, Nando's death starts to look like it might have been a suicide. It also becomes clear that the community's still reeling from the loss of several other young people. The mysterious circumstances of their demise dovetail with globalization's effects on the community: a drop in farming jobs and population exodus from the region. The film expands upon material that Gonz\u00e1lez's Cannes Critics' Week short, \"\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 el recuerdo?\" (\"The Solitude of Memory\"), previously broached. It displays dimensions of slow cinema and includes only 37 shots across its 62-minute duration.", "triples": [{"subject": "Caballerango", "predicate": "runtime", "object": "3720.0"}, {"subject": "Caballerango", "predicate": "director", "object": "Juan_Pablo_Gonz\u00e1lez"}, {"subject": "Caballerango", "predicate": "producer", "object": "Juan_Pablo_Gonz\u00e1lez"}]}
